polymorphism - a key principle in OOP is the idea that an object can take on many forms (morphs)

ex- The same class method works in a similar way for different classes

Cat.speak() meow
Dog.speak() woof
Human.speak() yo

method overriding - each subclass will have a different implementation of he method...
                    method is "overwritten" by a subclass!
