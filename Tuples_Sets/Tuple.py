#Tuple - an ordered collecytion grouping of items... not a list!!!!
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)

#It is immutable, cannot change the Tuple once it is defined! CAN NEVER BE CHANGED!!!!!

x = (1, 2, 3)
print(3 in x)
#True

alphabet = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
print(alphabet)

#Faster than lists, it makes your code safer!!!!!

#Valid keys in a dictionary ex - .items
#months in the year
#never change, in same order, should be a tuple
# use tuple function to use them or parenthesis

#Forloop for tuple
name = ("joe", "bill", "sally")
for name in name:
    print(name)
#can have nested Tuples
